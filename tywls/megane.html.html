	<p style = "color: green; font-size: 16px"> HI. Megane here. I'm currently a 17 year-old young woman living in Brooklyn, New York, joyfully anticipating her high school prom and graduation. I love to dance (I'm in fact in my school's Dance group). I'm short and I make up for my lack of height in personality and actions. I have a few favorite quotes made up by my friends and also by famous people.

	<p> <strong>BUT FIRST...</strong> Let's talk about favorite artists, movies and the likes. My love of music started with Rihanna's "SOS", moved on to Chris Brown's "With You", Usher's "Yeah!", then moving on to Beyonce's "Halo" and evoving into big girl music with Drake, Trey Songz, Nicki Minaj and many, many, <em>many</em> more.
